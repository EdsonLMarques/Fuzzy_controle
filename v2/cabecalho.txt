# Second version of Fuzzy controler in python
#
#fuzzy:
#Error and delta error = MN, N, PN, PP, P, MP ( 6 values that you have to decide the value)
#error and delta error are composed with 2 ramp equations with x variable values
# rule bases (you have to decide each intersection)
#    MN   N   PN   PP   P   MP
#MN|
# N|
#PN|
#PP|
# P|
#MP|
#
#Fuzzy output = MB, B, M, A, MA ( 6 values that you have to decide the value)
#fuzzy output = each value are composed with 2 ramp equations with x variable values
#
#I created a object caled Fuzzy, it are composed with some useful functions like calcula_erro that show the error value
